Title: Roman to Arabic numeral converter
Difficulty: Beginner

Create a program that converts Roman numbers (such as MCMLIV) to Arabic numbers (1954) and back.

Roman numerals are read from left to right, as you add or subtract the value of each symbol.

If a value is lower than the following value, it will be subtracted. Otherwise it will be added. 

For example, we want to convert the Roman numeral MCMLIV to an Arabic number:

M = 1000 must be added, because the following letter C =100 is lower.
C = 100 must be subtracted because the following letter M =1000 is greater.
M = 1000 must be added, because the following letter L = 50 is lower. 
L = 50 must be added, because the following letter I =1 is lower.
I = 1 must be subtracted, because the following letter V = 5 is greater.
V = 5 must be added, because there are no more symbols left.

We can now calculate the number: 
1000 - 100 + 1000 + 50 - 1 + 5 = 1954

Title: Latin Squares
Difficulty: Beginner

A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols each occuring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.

For example
1

And,
1  2 
2  1

are both valid Latin squares.

For this program you have to check whether a given array is a Latin square. If it is a Latin square, then display true otherwise display false.

The user will provide two inputs:
1. n - The length of a row in the array
2. A string representing the array of symbols

Example input

5
1 2 3 4 5 5 1 2 3 4 4 5 1 2 3 3 4 5 1 2 2 3 4 5 1
2
1 3 3 4
4
1 2 3 4 1 3 2 4 2 3 4 1 4 3 2 1 

Example output

true
false
false
