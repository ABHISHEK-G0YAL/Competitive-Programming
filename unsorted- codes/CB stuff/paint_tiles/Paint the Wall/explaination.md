FIrst test case has a 4 x 4 wall. You want to color 1 block in each row and only 1 block in each column. There are 24 valid ways to do this. Hence 24 is the output.

Second test case has a 3 x 3 wall. And there is only one way to paint that wall. Hence we output a matrix depicting how the wall should be colored.

Third test case has a 4 x 4 wall. And there is no possible way to paint the wall satisfying all the given conditions. Hence we output the string “No Possible Way”.
